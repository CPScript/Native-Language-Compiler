This complete implementation provides a **basic structure** for a **simple assembly language compiler**. The compiler includes tokenization, parsing, AST construction, and a placeholder for code generation. The tree-view file's components outlines the relationships between the various components of the compiler, making it easier to understand the structure and flow of the code. This basic learning example can be further expanded with additional features, optimizations, and error handling to create a more robust compiler. Have fun and dont stop learning.
